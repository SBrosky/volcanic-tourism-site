      <p>
        Visiting volcanoes has been gaining popularity in recent years. Social
        media has brought stunning images of ordinary people experiencing Mother
        Natureâ€™s greatest show to our living rooms. No longer just for
        geologists and those working for
        <strong><em>National Geographic</em></strong
        >, volcanic tourism is more accessible than ever.
        <br />
        <br />
        National parks surround many of the worldâ€™s active volcanoes, and offer
        hiking trails and road access to the craters once feared. With early
        warning systems in place, many feel volcanoes can be safely visited.
        Otherâ€™s disagree, with some scientists calling for a ban of volcanic
        tourism following the 2019 Whakaari eruption in New Zealand.
